    <h1>What is NDA?</h1>

    <p>
        In the world of Business Analysis, clear communication and confidentiality form the backbone of every successful project. 
        One of the most essential documents that protect sensitive information is the <strong>Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA)</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
        An NDA is a legally binding contract that ensures any confidential data shared between parties remains protected. 
        Whether a Business Analyst gathers requirements, reviews internal processes, or collaborates with stakeholders, 
        NDAs prevent unauthorized disclosure of project details, client data, business strategies, or intellectual property.
    </p>

    <p>
        Business Analysts often handle highly sensitive information such as system workflows, competitive insights, 
        customer data, and internal compliance reports. Without an NDA, organizations risk data leaks, reputational 
        damage, and financial loss. Therefore, understanding NDAs is not just a legal formality—it is a critical part 
        of a BA’s professional responsibility.
