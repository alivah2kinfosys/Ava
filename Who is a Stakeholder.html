    <p style="font-size: 18px; color: #333;">
        In the world of business analysis, the term <strong>stakeholder</strong> carries significant importance. 
        A stakeholder is any individual, group, or entity that is directly or indirectly affected by a project, 
        its processes, or its outcomes. Understanding stakeholders and managing their expectations is one of the 
        most essential responsibilities of a Business Analyst.

    <h2 style="color: #1a73e8; margin-top: 30px;">Definition of a Stakeholder</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 18px; color: #333;">
        A stakeholder is someone who has a vested interest in the success, progress, or result of a project. 
        Stakeholders can influence the direction of a project either positively or negatively. 
        Their needs, expectations, and concerns guide many decisions throughout the project lifecycle.
    </p>

    <h2 style="color: #1a73e8; margin-top: 30px;">Types of Stakeholders</h2>

    <ul style="font-size: 18px; color: #333; padding-left: 20px; line-height: 1.7;">
        <li><strong>Internal Stakeholders:</strong> Employees, managers, executives, and departments within the organization.</li>
        <li><strong>External Stakeholders:</strong> Customers, vendors, regulatory bodies, partners, and investors.</li>
        <li><strong>Primary Stakeholders:</strong> Individuals directly impacted by the project outcome.</li>
        <li><strong>Secondary Stakeholders:</strong> Individuals indirectly affected or who influence decisions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 style="color: #1a73e8; margin-top: 30px;">Why Stakeholders Matter</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 18px; color: #333;">
        Stakeholders help shape project goals, clarify requirements, identify risks, and ensure the final 
        deliverables align with organizational needs. Successful stakeholder engagement leads to smoother 
        communication, better decision-making, and higher chances of project success.
