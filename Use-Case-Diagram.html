  <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
    A <strong>Use Case Diagram</strong> is one of the most essential tools for a Business Analyst. It visually represents the interactions between users (actors) and the system to achieve specific business objectives. Learning to design accurate and detailed diagrams is an important skill taught in a

    helping professionals communicate system requirements effectively.

  <h2 style="color: #0056b3;">What Is a Use Case Diagram?</h2>
  <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
    A Use Case Diagram is part of the Unified Modeling Language (UML) used to describe system behavior through user interactions. It captures how external users (actors) interact with the system and identifies the system’s boundaries. It serves as a blueprint for understanding functional requirements and helps align business needs with technical design.
  </p>

  <h2 style="color: #0056b3;">Main Components of a Use Case Diagram</h2>
  <ol style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.8; padding-left: 20px;">
    <li><strong>Actors:</strong> The external users or systems that interact with the main system. Actors can be primary (initiating) or secondary (supporting) entities.</li>
    <li><strong>Use Cases:</strong> The actions or services the system performs in response to actors’ inputs. Each use case represents a specific goal.</li>
    <li><strong>System Boundary:</strong> The box that defines the scope of the system, showing what is included and excluded.</li>
    <li><strong>Relationships:</strong> Lines connecting actors and use cases that depict interactions or dependencies.</li>
    <li><strong>Includes and Extends:</strong> These represent reusable or optional relationships between use cases to handle variations and extensions in behavior.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2 style="color: #0056b3;">Purpose and Benefits</h2>
  <ul style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.8; padding-left: 20px;">
    <li>Clarifies how users will interact with the system.</li>
    <li>Identifies system boundaries and external dependencies early in the project.</li>
    <li>Improves communication between stakeholders, developers, and testers.</li>
    <li>Provides a high-level overview of functional requirements.</li>
    <li>Serves as a foundation for creating detailed use case specifications.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 style="color: #0056b3;">How to Create a Use Case Diagram</h2>
  <ol style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.8; padding-left: 20px;">
    <li><strong>Identify Actors:</strong> Determine who or what interacts with the system — users, departments, or external systems.</li>
    <li><strong>Define Use Cases:</strong> Document what each actor expects to achieve when interacting with the system.</li>
    <li><strong>Draw System Boundary:</strong> Outline the system’s scope to ensure clarity of responsibilities.</li>
    <li><strong>Connect Actors and Use Cases:</strong> Link each actor to the use cases they interact with.</li>
    <li><strong>Include Relationships:</strong> Use “Include” for mandatory sub-processes and “Extend” for optional or conditional flows.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2 style="color: #0056b3;">Example Scenario</h2>
  <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
    Consider an online banking system. The primary actors are “Customer” and “Admin.” Use cases might include “Login,” “Transfer Funds,” “View Balance,” and “Generate Reports.” A use case diagram will map how each actor interacts with these functions, ensuring no functionality is overlooked.
  </p>

  <h2 style="color: #0056b3;">Best Practices for Business Analysts</h2>
  <ul style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.8; padding-left: 20px;">
    <li>Use consistent naming conventions for actors and use cases.</li>
    <li>Keep diagrams simple and easy to understand for non-technical stakeholders.</li>
    <li>Combine textual use case documentation with diagrams for better clarity.</li>
    <li>Review and validate diagrams with stakeholders to ensure accuracy.</li>
    <li>Use diagramming tools such as Lucidchart, Visio, or Draw.io for clarity and professional presentation.</li>
  </ul>
