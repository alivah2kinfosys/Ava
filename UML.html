    <h1>Business Analyst: Standard Object Architecture and Relationship Model</h1>
    <p>
        In business analysis, understanding the <strong>standard object architecture and relationship model</strong> is crucial for structuring data and defining how various entities interact within a business system. Objects represent the key data elements or entities, such as customers, products, or orders, each containing specific attributes that describe them.
    </p>
    <p>
        The relationship model defines how these objects are interconnected. Common types of relationships include <strong>one-to-one</strong>, <strong>one-to-many</strong>, and <strong>many-to-many</strong>. For example, a single customer can have multiple orders (one-to-many), while an order may contain multiple products (many-to-many). These relationships enable analysts to map real-world business processes into logical structures that can be implemented within databases or CRM platforms like Salesforce.
    </p>
    <p>
        Business Analysts leverage object models to ensure system requirements accurately reflect business workflows. This clarity assists developers and stakeholders in maintaining consistency between business rules and technical implementation.
    </p>
    <p>
        Visual representations such as Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERDs) or <a href="https://www.h2kinfosys.com/courses/ba-online-training-course-details/" target="_blank">What is an UML?</a> (Unified Modeling Language) diagrams are often used to illustrate these relationships. UML diagrams help stakeholders understand the data flow, dependencies, and interactions across system modules, ensuring smooth communication and efficient design.
    </p>
    <p>
        By mastering object architecture and relationship modeling, Business Analysts can effectively bridge the gap between business needs and technical execution—enhancing scalability, data integrity, and overall system performance.
